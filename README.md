# Golden Sphere
Golden Sphere is an open-source game made for Concordia COMP371 (Computer Graphics) course. It is our take of the game Geometry Dash, built with OpenGL.

## Requirements
Golden Sphere requires an *OpenGl 3.3* capable graphics card and a display
with a minimum resolution of at least *1024x768*.

## Building
The project files for Visual Studio and Xcode are provided.
All the dependency binaries are included in the _ThirdParty/_ folder.

For MacOS users:
If the app doesn't link/run and you receive the following error:
```
Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libirrklang.dylib
 Referenced from: <spplication>
 Reason: image not found in the <path>
```
Copy `ThirdParty/irrKlang-1.6.0/lib/osx/libirrklang.dylib` and paste into `/usr/local/lib`.
